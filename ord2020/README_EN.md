# Exam TDT4100 Spring 2020

**Preparations for the exam - make sure everything works**

This is the development project for the home exam in 2020. We've added a package **sample**, containing some files:

- [Sample.java](src/sample/Sample.java)
- [SampleApp.java](src/sample/SampleApp.java)
- [SampleController.java](src/sample/SampleController.java)
- [SampleTest.java](src/sample/SampleTest.java)
- [sample.fxml](src/sample/sample.fxml)

It is vital that you run these, and make sure everything works. If it does, your IDE is ready for the exam. Once the exam starts we will add more packages that are based on the same setup. You can also rehearse zipping the project folder, this will be necessary for upload into Inspera. Instructions follow.

If it doesn't work, we recommend that you install Eclipse again, following the instructions at https://www.ntnu.no/wiki/display/tdt4100/Installasjon+av+Eclipse. This ensures that you have a clean installation - you do not have to uninstall the previous Eclipse installation. If things still don't work, please contact us.


## Delivery
When you are ready to deliver your exam, your project folder needs to be zipped and uploaded to Inspera. You can prepare the zip file like this:

**Zipping in Windows**
- Right-click the project icon in the leftmost 'Package Explorer' window in Eclipse.
- Choose 'Show in' -> click 'System Explorer'.
- You should now have a System Explorer window (not in Eclipse) open in a folder that most likely ends with 'git', for me it is 'C:\Users\borgeha\git'. The folder we want to compress is the project folder inside this git folder.
- Right click the project folder ord2020 -> Send to  -> Compressed (zipped) folder.
- Windows now compresses this folder into the git folder, and asks you to name it. Leave it as it is.
- This zip file is the one you shall upload to Inspera.
- You'll find a couple of screen shots of the process below.

**Zipping in OS X**
- Follow the same guideline as for Windows above, but instead chose to open in 'Finder'.
- Inside the Finder, right click the food_2020 and choose 'Compress'
- The resulting file is the one you upload to Inspera.
